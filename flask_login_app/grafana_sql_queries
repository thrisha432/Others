GRAFANA CODES 

1. Instantaneous Download Speed (MB/s) Graph (Gauge)

SELECT 
    strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S', timestamp) || '+05:30' AS time,  -- Keep it in IST format
    download_speed_mbps AS value,  -- The numerical value Grafana will plot (download speed)
    node_ip,
    'Download_speed_Mbps' AS metric  -- A label for the metric
FROM 
    speedtest_results
WHERE 
    node_ip IN ('10.32.240.223')
ORDER BY 
    time ASC;  -- Grafana expects time-series data in ascending order

2. Live Download Speed Trend (MB/s vs Time) Graph (Time Series- Last 15mins)

SELECT 
    strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S', timestamp) || '+05:30' AS time,  -- Keep it in IST format
    download_speed_mbps AS value,  -- The numerical value Grafana will plot (download speed)
    node_ip,
    'Download_speed_Mbps' AS metric  -- A label for the metric
FROM 
    speedtest_results
WHERE 
    node_ip IN ('10.32.240.223')
ORDER BY 
    time ASC;  -- Grafana expects time-series data in ascending order

3. Download Speed Distribution (MB/s) Graph (Pie Chart)

SELECT 
    CASE  
        WHEN download_speed_mbps < 1 THEN 'Below 1 MB/s'  
        WHEN download_speed_mbps BETWEEN 1 AND 2.75 THEN '1 - 2.75 MB/s'  
        ELSE 'Above 2.75 MB/s'  
    END AS metric,
    (COUNT(*) * 100.0) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM speedtest_results WHERE node_ip = '10.32.240.223') AS value
FROM 
    speedtest_results  
WHERE 
    node_ip = '10.32.240.223'  
GROUP BY 
    metric

FROM 
    speedtest_results
WHERE 
    node_ip IN ('10.32.240.223')
   
ORDER BY 
    time ASC;  -- Grafana expects time-series data in ascending order
